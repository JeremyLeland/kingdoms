New test
  - Scene class
    - Hold GL context
    - Camera and light information
    - Functions to draw given entity, line, etc
    - Lazy-loading for compiling shaders, preparing meshes, making VBAs, etc?
  - Try using VBAs
  - Draw single entity for now, with buttons (in HTML page) to click to trigger each animation
    - Start with a tree, so we can have "impact" and "fell" animations
      - Make tree have 3 cones, getting slightly smaller as you go up
      - Button sets animation and time, updates revert these after animation completes
      - Impact: slight woble back and forth on Z axis
      - Fell: Fall all the way onto side on Z axis

- Workers avoid each other when walking
  - And avoid trees and stockpiles
  - Make 2D test of this to try different avoidance techniques
    - Will want pathing at some point (e.g. account for lower transport costs for roads)
    - Classic avoid vector leads to lots of weird turning
      - What about yielding? Maybe one avoids, the other yields? Upper left always yields, for instance
      - What if we only turned right? Aim right until no longer close, then resume normal aiming?

- Stockpiles have their own delay?
  - So several workers can't dump several items at same time

- Pan camera with arrow keys

- Bush with berries
  - Bucket with berries to carry
    - Combine meshes? (create a bunch of half spheres and stick them together as one?)
      - Is this more efficient than a dozen or so individual spheres?

- Farm
  - Rows of cylinders, sphere end caps
  - Plants start folded up under ground
  - Animation raises them and opens them up? (for corn, maybe?)
  - Carrots are orange cone and green stuff
    - Slowly raise so part of orange sticks up and make green part bigger?
    - Carry carrots in basket?
