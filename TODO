- New test
  - Scene class
    - Hold GL context
    - Camera and light information

- Workers cut down trees
  - Add "swing" animation
  - Add axe (flat wide cone at top, simple cylinder for handle)
    - Axe head could be narrowing cylinder flattened
  - Need to attach axe to 'carry' attach point (or another?) when harvesting (and dettach when doing something else)
    - Should the axe be tracked like an object that can be dropped? Or just be part of the model?
    - If part of model, then need a way to account for parts of model only being visible during certain animations
    - If not, then the axe is another entity in the world...where does it live when not being used?
      - Does the axe have a lifecycle of sorts? Does it need to be picked up from somewhere and returned there?
      - Maybe keep them by town center? Or lumber yard, if we build those?
        - Stronghold has a building for each wood cutter. If we do that, the axe could be part of that building.

- Animations
  - Once or loop (just have loop: true or false?)
  - Interpolation: linear, square, sine/cosine? (alternate sine and cosine for oscilation between keyframes?)

- Workers avoid each other when walking
  - And avoid trees and stockpiles
  - Make 2D test of this to try different avoidance techniques
    - Will want pathing at some point (e.g. account for lower transport costs for roads)
    - Classic avoid vector leads to lots of weird turning
      - What about yielding? Maybe one avoids, the other yields? Upper left always yields, for instance
      - What if we only turned right? Aim right until no longer close, then resume normal aiming?

- Stockpiles have their own delay?
  - So several workers can't dump several items at same time

- Pan camera with arrow keys

- Bush with berries
  - Bucket with berries to carry
    - Combine meshes? (create a bunch of half spheres and stick them together as one?)
      - Is this more efficient than a dozen or so individual spheres?

- Farm
  - Rows of cylinders, sphere end caps
  - Plants start folded up under ground
  - Animation raises them and opens them up? (for corn, maybe?)
  - Carrots are orange cone and green stuff
    - Slowly raise so part of orange sticks up and make green part bigger?
    - Carry carrots in basket?
