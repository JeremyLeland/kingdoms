- Workers avoid each other when walking
  - And avoid trees and stockpiles

- Stockpiles have their own delay?
  - So several workers can't dump several items at same time

- Scene
  - with camera, lights, and entities
  - and draw function to handle them all

- Pan camera with arrow keys

- Bush with berries
  - Bucket with berries to carry
    - Combine meshes? (create a bunch of half spheres and stick them together as one?)
      - Is this more efficient than a dozen or so individual spheres?

- Farm
  - Rows of cylinders, sphere end caps
  - Plants start folded up under ground
  - Animation raises them and opens them up? (for corn, maybe?)
  - Carrots are orange cone and green stuff
    - Slowly raise so part of orange sticks up and make green part bigger?
    - Carry carrots in basket?
